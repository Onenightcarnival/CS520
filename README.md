# EleNa: Elevation-based Navigation

Navigation systems try to get the shortest or the fastest path from one point to another. However, in some cases we would like to further customize the way in which we travel. If you are working out, maybe you want to maximize the elevation or use the path with the least elevation changes. The EleNa project tries to find the best path between two points according to the user preferences. The user selects an origin and a destination and the amount of extra distance that he/she is willing to travel to either reduce or maximize the elevation gain.

## Getting Started
